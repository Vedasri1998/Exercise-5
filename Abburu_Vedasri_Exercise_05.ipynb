    "Output Explanation: The second array contains many zeros, indicating that most points are grouped into a primary cluster, with other values potentially representing smaller clusters or noise. Typically, -1 indicates noise, but it seems absent here, suggesting low noise or that the DBSCAN parameters (epsilon and min_samples) might be too permissive.\r\n",
